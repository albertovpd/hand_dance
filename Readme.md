## python3 base_sound.py & python3 hand_detection_saturday.py 
Real-time image-capturing feeding a subprocess that emits sound proportional to the output area of the main script.

#### Final project at Ironhack Madrid: An effective introduction to multiprocess libraries and tools in Pyhon and Linux Shell.
My name is Alberto, I am Physicist and from my point of view, as well as the known work with data, a Data Scientist must know how to take the best of its software and hardware, minimizing deadtime between processes and maximizing the queue work of scripts.

For this reason, I invest the week we had for deliver our final project in learning how to run parallel scripts, how to write synchronized and asynchronized scripts and how to feed a process with the output of other that is not "completely finished" yet, in a programming language, Python, which is designed to perform just one single task at time.

From all I learn about Multiprocessing, Async IO and integrated Python tools, my resulting scripts are the simplest I could find for the task I needed to solve.

## The project:

The following script clafiries my project:



### References:
    - The real-time image capturing script is based on this project:
        - https://github.com/sashagaz/Hand_Detection (Alexander Gazman).
        - It was written in Python 2 with deprecated code and I updated it to use it in Pyhon 3.6.

    - I used the recording_environment script just to check I could use all cores of my PC in the parallel process. The owner is:
